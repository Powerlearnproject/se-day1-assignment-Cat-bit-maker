Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

	1968: The first NATO Software Engineering Conference is held.
The conference was held in Garmisch Germany. It was held to highlight the problems and challenges in software development during the 1960s. The problems and challenges addressed were things like late software production, over budget, and poor quality. 
The conference led to the recognition of software engineering as a discipline and spurred the development of methodologies and tools to improve the quality and management of software projects. 
The conference helped formalize the field of software engineering.
	1970s: Several new methodologies are developed, including structured and object-oriented programming.
Edsger Dijkstra and other pioneers revolutionized software development. In his influential paper, Edsger argued against using unstructured control flow in programs and advocated for a more systematic approach to code structure. 
Structured programming improves code readability, maintainability, and debugging. 

	2000s: The agile movement
The Agile movement began with the Agile Manifesto in 2001. It shifted away from rigid methods like Waterfall. Agile focuses on iterative development and customer collaboration. It values frequent software delivery, a steady work pace, and adapting to changes.
It prioritizes flexibility and customer feedback. Teams now adapt to changes more easily and deliver value faster. 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

	Requirements gathering and analysis
In the initial planning phase of software development, we focus on understanding what the software needs to do by gathering and analyzing requirements from stakeholders. This includes conducting interviews, surveys, and workshops, analyzing existing systems, and documenting user needs and expectations. The output is a Requirements Specification Document that details the software's features, constraints, and objectives. Additionally, we evaluate technical and financial feasibility, prioritize features, and create key documents like the Project Plan and Software Requirements Specification (SRS) to guide the development process. This phase ensures clear communication, collaboration, and a solid foundation for the project.
	Design
In the Design phase, the team creates a detailed blueprint of the software, including system architecture, data models, and user interfaces. They produce diagrams, choose technologies, and define system components. This results in a Software Design Document (SDD) that guides the coding phase and ensures the software is user-friendly and functional.
	Implementation
In the Implementation phase, developers write and test code according to the design specifications, integrate components, and conduct unit testing to ensure everything works. This results in source code and executable software, marking the transition from design to a working software product.
	Testing
In the Testing phase, the software is thoroughly examined through unit, integration, system, and acceptance tests to find and fix bugs, ensuring it meets all requirements and functions correctly, resulting in test reports and a refined, bug-free product.
	Deployment
In the Deployment phase, the software is installed and configured on user systems, and support is provided to ensure it operates correctly in the live environment, resulting in operational software ready for end users.
	Maintenance
In the Maintenance phase, ongoing support is provided, including fixing bugs, applying updates, and adapting the software to new needs or changes, ensuring it remains functional and meets user needs over time.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
